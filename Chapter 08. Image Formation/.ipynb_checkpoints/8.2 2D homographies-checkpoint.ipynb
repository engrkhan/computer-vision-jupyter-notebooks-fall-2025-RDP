    "In computer vision, a homography is usually defined as a **perspective transformation of a plane**, in other workds, a reprojection of a plane from one camera image into a different one, where the camera may have been translated and/or rotated. As a consequence, **any two images of the same planar surface in space are related by a homography**. This has many practical applications, such as image rectification, image registration, etc. For 2D homographies, we have a $3x3$ matrix containing the linear transformation:$\\\\[010pt]$\n",
