    "# 10.2 Epipolar geometry\n",
    "\n",
    "Epipolar geometry is the geometry of stereo vision. When two cameras view a 3D scene from two different positions, there are a number of geometric relations between the 3D points and their projections onto the 2D images that lead to constraints between the image points. These relations are derived based on the assumption that the cameras can be approximated by the pinhole camera model. $\\\\[10pt]$\n",

    "\n",
    "Before starting to explain how epipolar geometry works, we have to understand some basic concepts:\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"./images/epipolar1.png\" width=\"600\" />\n",
    "\n",
    "First of all, we have the **epipolar plane**. This plane is formed by 3 points: the left and right focal points ($C_l,\\ C_r$), and a point of the world ($X$). \n",
    "\n",
    "The interesting thing about the epipolar plane, is that it intersects the images at the **conjugate epipolar lines** of the StereoVision System. The projections of the point $X$ are contained in their corresponding epipolar line. In this way, it would be interesting to know how to compute these epipolar lines because we can check if a match of points is correct or not (to find the matching point in other image, you don't need to search the whole image, just search along the line). This is called **Epipolar Constraint**. In the same way, all points will have its corresponding epilines in the other image.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Given a two-camera configuration (represented by $R,t$), for each 3D point there is a **unique epipolar plane** and, consequently, a **unique pair of epipolar lines**.* \n",
    "\n",
    "You can notice that all epipolar lines intersect in one point, this point is called the **epipole**, and it is the projection of the focal point of a camera on the other image plane (may be outside the boundary of the image). All the epilines pass through its epipole. So to find the location of epipole, we can find many epilines and find their intersection point.:\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"./images/epipolar2.png\" width=\"600\" />\n",
    "\n",
    "The epipoles are the most interesting points in epipolar geometry because once they are located, it is possible to find all epipolar lines. There are some special cases where one or both epipoles are in the infinity (if the image plane is parallel to the line $C_l-C_r$):\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"./images/epipolar3.png\" width=\"800\" />\n",
